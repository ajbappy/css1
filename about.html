<h1 class="h3">About us</h1>
<h2 align="center" class="h2">Through shelter, we empower</h2>
<p class="about-p">Habitat for Humanity Australia is part of Habitat for Humanity, an international not-for-profit which originated in Georgia, United States in 1976. Habitat for Humanity began as a grassroots effort driven by the vision of a world where everyone has a safe and decent place to live. The housing organisation has since grown to become a leading global non-profit working in more than 70 countries. Since then it has been our mission to build strength, stability, and self-reliance through shelter.

Worldwide, Habitat has helped more than 35 million people access safe and decent housing,  along with access to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene and livelihood training to build better lives.

Through financial support, volunteering or adding a voice to support affordable housing, everyone can help families build a better tomorrow, today. Through shelter, we empower.</p>
