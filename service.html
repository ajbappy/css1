	<p>We work in partnership with families to build or improve a place they can call home. Access to safe housing provides more than a roof overhead. It means safety and security. It offers children a space to study, is instrumental in improving the health and wellbeing of families, acts as a base to start a thriving home enterprise and provides a solid foundation to break the cycle of poverty.

The building of safe and decent homes forms part of our broader community development program that also addresses disaster risk reduction, water, sanitation and hygiene, urban development, land tenure, market development and advocacy.

In Australia, our domestic programs are delivered through our state partners and focus on helping vulnerable families access affordable housing solutions.</p>

<p>In October last year, Sceggs Darlinghurst sent 53 students and 10 teachers to Siem Reap in Cambodia to help build 5 homes for vulnerable families in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

The common problem for these families was that most lived in housing shelters made of wood and palm leaves, leaving their homes vulnerable to the harsh weather and insects.

The students assisted by building new, upgraded homes made of timber, providing access to adequate housing, health, and opportunities for the families to be in a better financial position.

Following the build, Sceggs produced a beautiful book full of photos and well wishes which were presented to the families, who stood proudly in front of their new homes.



Some of the students also expressed what the build experience was like for them:

I believe that the experience was very worthwhile and it is a trip I will never forget. I learnt a lot about the culture in Cambodia and the relationships that we made with the local community overcame the language barriers. The families were very grateful for what we had done and the handover ceremony was very sad, yet happy at the same time. – Emma



I think this trip was so eye-opening and really helped expand my world and make me a more thoughtful, conscious person. – Phoebe

During my five days of building not only did I form stronger relationships with my build group but I learnt so much about the family we were building for and how different their lives are. – Tui</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
